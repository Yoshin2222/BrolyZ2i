I AM NOT A DEV, AND BROLY IS NOT DONE!!!!
Things are liable to change between this and the final release.
He is lacking intros, winposes and finishers. Alongside other little
things to make him complete. For now, he seems to be fairly stable
Special commands are
	Charge - Back to Forward + Punch - Goliath charge
	Charge - Down to Up + Punch - Saiyan Rainfall
	QCF + K - Cosmic Pressure
	QCFx2 + P - Power Bomb
	QCFx2 + 2P - Gigas Breaker
	Can charge ST.LP by holding the button
	Broly can Power Charge (MP+MK) in the air even with Max meter
Maximum Mode causes certain moves to gain new
properties, and Broly passively gains meter. However,
he also gradually loses life. He also gains access to
a Focus Attack Cancel (can cancel in to Focus Attack as
you would a special move. Costs Meter to perform)
